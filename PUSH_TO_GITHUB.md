# 🚀 Push Your Code to GitHub

## Quick Instructions:

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name it: `Streamlit Deployment`
4. Select scope: ✅ **repo** (check the entire repo section)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/magicben/Desktop/Client portfolio"

# Push to GitHub (will ask for credentials)
git push -u origin main
```

**When prompted:**
- Username: `qtsalpha`
- Password: **PASTE YOUR TOKEN** (not your GitHub password!)

### Step 3: Verify

Go to: https://github.com/qtsalpha/structurednotestracker

You should see all your files there!
